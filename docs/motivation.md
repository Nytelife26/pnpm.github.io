# Flat `node_modules`

When using npm or Yarn, if you have 100 projects using a dependency, you will
have 100 copies of that dependency saved on disk. This is caused by the use of
a flat `node_modules` structure. However, with pnpm, the dependency will be
stored in a content-addressable store, so:

1. If you depend on different versions of the dependency, only the files that
differ are added to the store. For instance, if it has 100 files, and a new
version has a change in only one of those files, `pnpm update` will only add 1
new file to the store, instead of cloning the entire dependency just for the
singular change.
1. All the files are saved in a single place on the disk. When packages are
installed, their files are hard-linked from that single place, consuming no
additional disk space. This allows you to share dependencies of the same version
across projects.

As a result, you save a lot of space on your disk proportional to the number of
projects and dependencies, and you have a lot faster installations!

If you'd like more details about the unique `node_modules` structure that pnpm
creates and why it works fine with the Node.js ecosystem, read this small
article, and our corresponding documentation about the content-addressable
store:
